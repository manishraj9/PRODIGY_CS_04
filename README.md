#PRODIGY_CS_03
HI,
HERE I AM DOING THE FOURTH PROJECT OF CYBER SECURITY(CS) INTERNSHIP OF PRODIGY INFOTECH.
**PROJECT NAME- Simple Keylogger
PROJECT DESCRIPTION- Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.**
**PROJECT CORRELATION IN REAL LIFE -** 
-Keyloggers, while having some legitimate uses, are often employed for malicious purposes like stealing sensitive information, violating privacy, and enabling cybercrime. Some real-world examples of how keyloggers are misused include:
-Stealing login credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal data from unsuspecting victims
-Monitoring employees or family members without their knowledge or consent
-Conducting corporate or government espionage by gathering confidential information
-Blackmailing or extorting victims with the stolen data
**DEFINITION** - Keyloggers can be deployed through physical access to a device or remotely via malware. They record every keystroke, allowing attackers to reconstruct private messages, passwords, and other sensitive information.
**HISTORICAL ASPECT**- Early Developments:
Cold War Era: The origins of keylogging can be traced back to the Cold War, where Soviet engineers developed a device known as the "Selectric bug." This device was designed to spy on electric typewriters, allowing for covert monitoring of typed communications in sensitive environments, such as U.S. diplomatic facilities in Moscow and Leningrad. This early form of keylogging demonstrated the potential for technology to be used for espionage and surveillance purposes .
Emergence of Computer Keyloggers
1980s: The first computer-based keylogger was created in 1983 by Perry Kivolowitz as a proof of concept. This marked the transition from hardware-based keylogging to software applications that could record keystrokes on personal computers. As computers became more prevalent in both personal and professional settings, the potential for keyloggers to capture sensitive information grew significantly .
Notable Incidents and Evolution
2000s: Keyloggers evolved with the rise of the internet and digital communication. They became more sophisticated, often bundled with malware or distributed through phishing attacks. One notable incident occurred in 2015 when a keylogger was discovered bundled with a mod for the popular video game Grand Theft Auto V. This highlighted how keyloggers could be distributed through seemingly innocuous software, making them a significant threat to users .
2017 Incident: A significant case involved Hewlett Packard laptops that were shipped with a keylogger pre-installed. HP claimed that this tool was intended for diagnosing keyboard performance and should have been removed before shipment, illustrating how keyloggers could unintentionally enter the market through legitimate channels .
Current Trends and Challenges
Modern Keyloggers: Today, keyloggers can be classified into two main types: software and hardware. Software keyloggers can intercept keystrokes through various methods, such as API-based logging or form grabbing, while hardware keyloggers can be physically connected to devices or built into keyboards. This duality allows for a range of applications, from legitimate monitoring to malicious data theft .
Legitimate Uses vs. Malicious Intent: While keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as employee monitoring and parental controls, they are often associated with criminal activities, including identity theft and corporate espionage. The legality of keyloggers varies by context, with ethical considerations surrounding their use remaining a contentious issue.
